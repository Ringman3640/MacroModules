MacroModules is a Windows desktop application for designing and running your own custom macros.

A macro is a set of computer actions that execute sequentially, usually triggered by a user input such as a key press. They allow for repetitive computer tasks to be partially or fully automated. 

MacroModules uses a block programming model to design macros. Individual computer actions are represented by visual blocks called **Modules** that can be connected together with other Modules. A macro is made a chain consisting of one or more connected Modules.

The length of a macro varies based on the complexity of the macro behavior. A macro may consist of one or two Modules to support accessibility needs. A macro may also consist of tens of Modules to fully automate a tedious computer task.
