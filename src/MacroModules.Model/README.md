# MacroModules.Model
The Model project is responsible for implementing the macro execution logic of the application as C# library. By itself, it is capable of fully defining and executing macros programatically. 

The following is a class diagram that provides an overview of the structure of the project. The class diagram only covers the major classes in the library. Smaller and repetitive classes, such as each discrete Module class, are not included for brevity.

[draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) was used to design the class diagram. The model file can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xa_LTaS96kyISxRA8X9YvKlVrmvLKcm1/view?usp=sharing).
